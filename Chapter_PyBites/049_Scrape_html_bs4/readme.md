As this page is changing all the time (and to not hit their servers too much) we saved a copy of the html on our server and loaded it into CONTENT

Now the best part: meet your new best friend when dealing with HTML: BeautifulSoup, a module that makes dealing with html a breeze.

Get coding: complete get_book by making a Soup object and parsing out the relevant fields as defined in Book. Next populate and return this namedtuple.

Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!
