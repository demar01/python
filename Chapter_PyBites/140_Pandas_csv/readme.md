# Bite 140. PyBites First Pandas Bite

## Description 

This is a Pandas proof-of-concept Bite. We just added the library to our platform!

For this Bite you find out the male and female athletes who won most medals in all the Summer Olympic Games (csv = 1896-2012, but we also test a smaller subset of the data).

Expect more Pandas Bites to start appearing on our platform ...
