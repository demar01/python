# Bite 122. Check if two words are anagrams

## Description 


An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.[1] For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into "naga ram". Or for example, the word binary can be rearranged into "brainy". - source
