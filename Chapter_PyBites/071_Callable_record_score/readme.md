# Bite 71. Keep state in a class + make its instance callable

## Description

In this Bite you write a small class to keep track of the max score in a game. When called as a function it receives a new score and returns the max score. Note it should work with negative numbers as well.

This is how it should work:

>>> from record import RecordScore

  >>> record = RecordScore()
  >>> print(record(10))
  10
  >>> print(record(9))
  10
  >>> print(record(11))  # new max
  11

  >>> record = RecordScore()
  >>> print(record(-5))
  -5
  >>> print(record(-10))
  -5
  >>> print(record(-2))  # new max
  -2


  Use the __call__ dunder ("special") method to make the RecordScore class callable.

Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
