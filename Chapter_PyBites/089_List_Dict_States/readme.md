# Bite 89. Playing with lists and dicts

## Description

In this Bite you are presented with a us_state_abbrev dict and a states list.

Complete the four methods in the template below (you might have to scroll down): get_every_nth_state, get_state_abbrev, get_longest_state and combine_state_names_and_abbreviations, following the instructions in their docstrings.

We hope this gives you a good feeling of how you can get data out of these two data structures.

Of course there is a lot more to it, you will come to appreciate the power of each data structure by continuous usage. So keep coding and improving your Python skills. And have fun!
