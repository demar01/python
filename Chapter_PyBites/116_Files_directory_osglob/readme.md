# Bite 116. List and filter files in a directory

## Decription

In this Bite you complete get_files that receives a dirname and size_in_kb (note kb, not bytes).

There are two things you need to code:

1- Inspect/list the files in dirname,
2- Return files that are bigger or equal than size_in_kb (return a list or turn the function into a generator).


The os module is your friend here, but you also might want to check out glob. Have fun and keep coding in Python!
