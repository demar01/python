# Bite 38. Using ElementTree to parse XML

## Description

In this Bite you will use ElementTree to parse some Nolan movies we extracted from OMDb.

Luckily most APIs switched to JSON, but sometimes XML is all there is, so at least learn to parse some! Complete the get_tree, get_movies and get_movie_longest_runtime functions below. See the docstrings and tests for more info.

Have fun and remember:

Keep calm and code in Python!
